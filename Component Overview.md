- Props: `post` object.
- Uses Link component for detailed view hyperlink.
- Purpose: Reusable component for summarized blog posts.

**PostPage.js:**
- Functional component for detailed view of a single blog post.
- Uses useParams, useStoreActions, and useStoreState.
- Provides conditional rendering based on post existence.
- Purpose: Detailed view with edit/delete options.

**Store.js:**
- Configures state management using easy-peasy.
- Defines state properties, actions, computed properties, and thunks related to blog posts.
- Purpose: Centralized store for managing application state.

The purpose of each file/component is to contribute to the overall structure, functionality, and user experience of the React blog post application, with a focus on modularity and easy maintenance.

**posts.js (API Configuration):**
- File in the API folder of the React app.
- Contains an import statement for Axios, a popular HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- Exports an instance of Axios created with `create` method.
- Configures the base URL for the Axios instance to be 'http://localhost:5000'.
  
**Purpose:**
This file sets up a reusable Axios instance with a base URL pointing to 'http://localhost:5000'. It simplifies API calls in the React app, providing a centralized configuration for making requests to the specified server. This can enhance code organization and maintainability by isolating API-related logic.

**useAxiosFetch.js (Custom Hook for Data Fetching):**
- File in the hooks folder of the React app.
- Imports useState, useEffect from 'react', and axios for making HTTP requests.
- Defines a custom hook named useAxiosFetch that takes a dataUrl as a parameter.
- Uses state variables (data, fetchError, isLoading) to manage fetched data, fetch errors, and loading state.
- Inside the useEffect hook, sets up a cancel token to handle component unmounting.
- Fetches data from the specified URL using axios.get.
- Updates state variables based on the success or failure of the fetch operation.
- Implements cleanup logic to cancel the request and prevent memory leaks upon component unmounting.
- Returns an object with data, fetchError, and isLoading to be used in the consuming components.

**Purpose:**
This custom hook simplifies data fetching in React components by encapsulating the logic related to HTTP requests. It provides a clean interface for components to initiate data fetching, handle loading states, and manage the fetched data or errors. The use of cancel tokens in conjunction with useEffect ensures efficient cleanup and avoids potential issues with asynchronous operations during component unmounting.

**useWindowSize.js (Custom Hook for Window Size):**
- File in the hooks folder of the React app.
- Imports useState and useEffect from "react".
- Defines a custom hook named useWindowSize with no parameters.
- Uses state variable windowSize to store the current width and height of the window.
- Inside the useEffect hook:
  - Defines a function handleResize to update windowSize based on the current window dimensions.
  - Calls handleResize once to set initial window size.
  - Adds an event listener for the "resize" event to dynamically update windowSize on window resizing.
  - Implements cleanup logic to remove the event listener when the component unmounts.
- Returns an object containing the width and height of the window.

**Purpose:**
This custom hook provides a straightforward way for React components to access and track the current dimensions of the browser window. By encapsulating window size logic in a reusable hook, it promotes cleaner and more modular code. Components using this hook can efficiently respond to changes in window size without cluttering their code with event listeners and resize logic.
